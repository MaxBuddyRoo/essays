[DING DONG THE WICKED BITCH IS DEAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILvd5buCEnU)

Completely unrelated but when researching I found a Reddit comment saying ["Like the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz, she was badly in need of a heart."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism_101/comments/vss47v/comment/if3dixw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and I thought that went so unreasonably hard for a Reddit comment I just felt the need to include it. Also the song "Ding Dong! The witch is dead!" got #5 on the billboards the week she died, [I'm not kidding.](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/ding-dong-the-witch-is-dead-closer-to-number-one-spot-as-it-reaches-top-five-following-margaret-thatcher-s-death-8566042.html)
