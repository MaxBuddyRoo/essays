Based off of the [dessalines Socialism FAQ](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/socialism_faq.md), but I'm not a tankie, this isn't a fact sheet like [The Source Library](https://source-library.github.io/source-library/), but this will have links to some.

Oh yeah, some of the resources will call USSR/China/etc. socialist/communist, but IMO they are state capitalist, for reasons that should be obvious later, but because of like all lefty subs enforcing "left unity" I sadly have to rely on a few libs.

ALSO THIS IS AN EARLY WIP, NO WHERE *NEAR* AS BIG AS I WANT IT TO BE, this is just me adding whatever useful links i find and organizing them
