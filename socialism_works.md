A lot of the time you will often hear capitalists say "socialism doesn't work", so here are some examples of socialism working in github form. (A lot of this was taken from Xexizy's [Socialism HAS Worked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIddCEBCKHQ) and MrKazuma's [Communism Works](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wSMbJHwN_Pw54SFKkbeHdSM6VKoi7fGg0XR4RUy2Fio/edit), so credit to them both)

- Formed in Ukraine from an anarchist revolution to counter the oppression of the workers by the Bolsheviks.
- Declared freedom of speech, press, and assembly inalienable rights.
- Ukrainian workers started managing their own affairs in communes and sent delegates to participate in regional congresses:
-  - “The first conference was followed by a second. The problems of organizing life according to the principles of self-management by the workers were examined and discussed with animation by the masses of workers, who all welcomed this idea with the greatest enthusiasm, but who only with difficulty succeeded in giving it concrete forms….Shortly after the workers’ meetings, a regional congress of peasants and workers was called at Aleksandrovsk for October 20, 1919. More than 200 delegates took part, among whom 180 were peasants, and the rest workers. The congress dealt with: a) military questions (the struggle against Denikin; reinforcement and maintenance of the insurrectionary army); b) questions dealing with constructive activity in the region…The congress resolved numerous problems concerning the insurrectionary army, its organization and reinforcement. It was proposed that men up to the age of 48 enlist in this army. In keeping with the spirit of the congress, this enrollment would be voluntary, but as general as possible, in view of the extremely dangerous situation of the region. Earlier we already mentioned the meaning of the voluntary 10-year mobilization which was proposed at the second regional congress on February 12, 1919. The resolution on mobilization passed by the October congress had the same meaning. The congress decided that the supplying of the army would be done primarily by free gifts from the peasants, in addition to spoils of victory and requisitions from privileged groups. In the domain of internal constructive activity, the congress limited itself for the time being to indicating general guidelines — that the workers, without any authority, should themselves organize their lives by their own efforts and means.”
