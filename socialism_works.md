A lot of the time you will often hear capitalists say "socialism doesn't work", so here are some examples of socialism working in github form. (A lot of this was taken from Xexizy's [Socialism HAS Worked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIddCEBCKHQ) and MrKazuma's [Communism Works](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wSMbJHwN_Pw54SFKkbeHdSM6VKoi7fGg0XR4RUy2Fio/edit), so credit to them both)
